# Exercises
Learning data engineering fundamentals through challenges.

Here, I go through some data engineering challenges that my friend sent me. They are mostly focused on getting, cleaning, and processing data in various ways. These challenges do not have an answer key, so each exercise will be the way I can figure out how to achieve the desired result by any means!

The challenges can be found here https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice/tree/main
